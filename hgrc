[perfarce]

## If the keep option is true (this is default) then the Perfarce
## extension will keep the p4 workarea updated with the current top of
## tree in p4. If keep is false then the Perfarce extension does not
## leave files in the p4 workarea unless it is creating a changelist.
# keep = False
# Temporarily turning on to see if it speeds up checkout of MobileMain
keep = True

## If the submit option is true then Perfarce will automatically
## submit a changelist when pushing changes to the p4 depot. The
## default is to create a pending changelist, and let the user review
## this before submitting, either with p4 submit or hg p4submit.
submit = False

## If the tags option is true (this is the default) then Perfarce will
## convert p4 labels into Mercurial tags. If tags is false then p4
## labels are ignored. This can be used to reduce loading on the p4
## server.
tags = False

## If the lowercasepaths option is true then the Perfarce extension
## forces all directory names received from p4 to lowercase, but
## leaving filenames unchanged. The default is to preserve directory
## and file names.

# FSK had played with varying lowercasepaths settings
# FSK (True on some machines, False on others)
# FSK but hgx says to use ignorecase = True
# FSK and that (below) might subsume lowercasepaths
ignorecase = True

## The clientuser option allows for 'cheap' multiuser operation with
## p4. The option argument is split on the first space into a search
## regular expression and a replacement string. If the regular
## expression matches the client spec name of an imported p4
## changelist then the username for the changelist is changed to the
## value of the replacement string after it is capitalized. The
## replacement string can use regex matches to substitute part of the
## client spec name.An example could be
##
##   clientuser = ([a-z]+)\.([a-z-]+)--[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+ \1 \2 <\1.\2@example.com>
##
## which turns "firstname.lastname--my-client-name"
## into "Firstname Lastname <firstname.lastname@example.com>"
